## SharePoint Testing POC Console Application.

*Purpose:*

* This application serves to allow a user to provide their credentials along with Share Point site information – to allow for Uploading, Deleting and Listing Items.

*About:*

* The application uses Share Point 2013 CSOM (Client-side Object Model). Which takes advantage of Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll & Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll.

>Final Thoughts:
This document is pretty “light” on purpose. The code has comments on each line – which will provide more insight on a line-by-line basis.
